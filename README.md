# march-madness-2024
## 3/11/2024 First Release
Completed initial release of code for predicting the outcome of the NCAA march madness tournament. The `sandbox` notebook will process the Kaggle dataset and transform the data into a very data set for modeling. The `model` notebook will train a very basic linear model and compute a featureless score for comparison. 

### TODO List Before Next Release
- [ ] Implement logic to select the best performing model to use for final bracket predictions
- [ ] Introduce more features to the dataset surrounding team stats from the season
- [ ] Add more models for comparison against the logistic regression model
